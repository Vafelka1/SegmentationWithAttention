# Attention based underwater image segmentation
## Abstract
Semantic Segmentation is a popular problem in the computer vision domain which is used for estimating scene geometry, inferring interactions and spatial relationships among objects, salient object identification, etc., [1]. On a broader level, segmentation involves three steps, classifying certain objects in an image, localizing them, and grouping the pixels in the localized image by creating a segmentation mask [8].<p>
 
The recent introduction of transformer-based models and attention mechanisms in computer vision tasks has taken the spotlight. In this project, we are interested in applying the attention mechanism to a new segmentation model from [1] to underwater images. Semantic segmentation of underwater images is not well explored as in the case with terrestrial object segmentation. Authors of [1] have curated a dataset called Segmentation of Underwater IMagery (SUIM) and implemented SOTA segmentation models on it to compare with their model called SUIM-Net. We tweaked the SUIM-Net Residual Skip Block (RSB) by experimenting with the Efficient Channel Attention module [2] and Triplet Attention module [3] inside the SUIM-Net.<br>

## Experiment setup
• Batch size: 4<br>
• Epochs: 40<br>
• steps per epoch: 100<br>
• learning rate: 1e-4<br>
• optimizer: Adam<br>
• loss = 'binary_crossentropy’<br>
• GPU: Tesla T4 (Colab pro)<br>
*SUIM-Net + ECA - 18 + 22 + 40 epochs: There were breaks in the training of SUIM-Net
training. Though the plots of SUIM-Net + ECA look different, the results are identical to
the other two experiments but on a different scale.<br>
